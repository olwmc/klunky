# Klunky
Klunky lets you expose a part of your existing application to a local HTTP server.

Essentially, a generalizable form of the API provided by [Ankiconnect][https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/].

This is my first asynchronous project, so I'm learning a lot as I go. This library really is not meant to be used.
