# Klunky
Klunky lets you expose a part of your existing application to a local HTTP server.

Essentially, a generalizable form of the API provided by [Ankiconnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/).

This library is not only incomplete but also unstable and primitively implemented! Don't use it!
